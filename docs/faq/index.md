<summary><b>What is a faucet? Where can I find the official Evmos mainnet faucet?</b></summary>

A faucet is an application that dispenses small amounts of cryptocurrencies to users for free. The purpose of a faucet is to introduce new users to a cryptocurrency by giving them a small amount of tokens to play with, and to encourage them to explore the network’s features and potential use cases.

You can claim from the official Evmos faucet in the [faucet channel](https://discord.com/channels/809048090249134080/1030344710205747271) found in our Discord server.

## Wallets / Addresses

<details>

<summary><b>Which wallets can I use for Evmos?</b></summary>

You can find an overview of Evmos-compatible wallets [here](https://academy.evmos.org/articles/beginner/wallets).

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>How do I connect Evmos to my wallet?</b></summary>

Guides on how to add the Evmos network to your wallet:

- Metamask [guide](https://academy.evmos.org/articles/beginner/wallets)
- Keplr [guide](https://academy.evmos.org/articles/beginner/connect-your-wallet/keplr)

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Can I use Ledger with Evmos?</b></summary>

Yes. A guide on how to start using Ledger with Evmos can be found [here](https://academy.evmos.org/articles/beginner/connect-your-wallet/ledger).

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Why are there 2 different types of Evmos addresses on Keplr?</b></summary>

Keplr supports two different types of Evmos addresses: the EVM compatible (hex) address and the Cosmos SDK (bech32) address.

The EVM compatible address is the address format used by the Ethereum network, and it starts with "0x". This format is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem and is recognized by many wallets and applications.

The Cosmos SDK address is the address format used by the Cosmos network, which Evmos is built on. This format starts with "evmos1". This format is specific to the Cosmos ecosystem and is not widely recognized by wallets and applications outside of it. However, it is used by Evmos to interact with the Cosmos ecosystem, including staking, governance, and other features.

Keplr supports both address formats to provide users with a more seamless experience when using Evmos. Users can easily switch between the two formats when interacting with different types of applications on the Evmos network.

Both formats represent the same address/account.

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Can I use the same Evmos address/account on both Metamask and Keplr at the same time?</b></summary>

Yes, you can use the same Evmos address on both Metamask and Keplr at the same time. This is because Evmos is a blockchain network that supports both EVM and Cosmos networks.

Both Metamask and Keplr allow you to import your Evmos address by using your private key or seed phrase, which means that you can access your account on either wallet.

However, keep in mind that you should always keep your private key or seed phrase secure and not share it with anyone. Additionally, it's always a good idea to have a backup of your private key or seed phrase in case you lose access to one of your wallets.

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Are there any mobile wallet apps that support IBC transfers?</b></summary>

Yes, Cypher wallet and Cosmostation wallet both support IBC transfers.

</details>

## Staking

<details>

<summary><b>Is there a difference between (un/re)staking, (un/re)bonding  and (un/re)delegating?</b></summary>

No. Staking, bonding and delegating all refer to the process of locking tokens to participate in a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network and earn token rewards for supporting the network.

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>How long does the unbonding process take on the Evmos network?</b></summary>

The time it takes to unstake tokens on the Evmos network is set to 14 days, during which no staking rewards are earned.

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Why is there a 2-week period to unbond my staked tokens? What happens during those 2 weeks?</b></summary>

The reasoning behind having an unbonding period is the following:

1. To enforce the solution to the nothing-at-stake problem
2. To protect against long-range attacks

The unbonding period of 2 weeks is artificial and is set by governance.

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>I accidentally undelegated my Evmos tokens. Can I cancel the undelegation process?</b></summary>

Yes, you can do so via [Disperze](https://evmos.disperze.network/welcome), which is a third-party dashboard for the Evmos network.

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Where can I check the time left until my staked tokens are fully unbonded?</b></summary>

1. Navigate to [https://www.mintscan.io/evmos](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos)
2. Search for your Evmos address using the search bar
3. Click on the “Unbondings” tab

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Does it also take 14 days to re-delegate my tokens to a different validator?</b></summary>

This depends. If it is your first time re-delegating your tokens, the redelegation process is instant. However, if you have redelegated Evmos tokens before, the process will take 14-days (during which no tokens will be earned).

</details>

<summary><b>How do I change the Evmos RPC in Metamask?</b></summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>My staked tokens unbonded themselves. What is happening?</b></summary>

This most likely means that your private key has been compromised. If you are a victim of theft and have staked tokens, act quickly! The staked assets may still be recoverable. Contact either [Cosmoshield](https://cosmoshield.org/) or [Cosmos Rescue](https://cosmosrescue.com/) as soon as you become aware of the theft attempt.

Alternatively, you can contact our moderators in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/evmos) server and ask for assistance.
