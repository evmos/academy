# EVM Extensions - Staking & Distribution

Learn how to use Evmos EVM extensions to include Evmos and Cosmos SDK module functionalities in your smart contracts.

Stateful EVM Extensions on the core protocol allow dApps and users to access logic outside of the EVM.
Acting as a gateway, these EVM Extensions define how smart contracts can perform cross-chain transactions
(via IBC) and interact with core functionalities on the Evmos chain (e.g. staking, voting) from the EVM.

:::tip
**Note**: Not sure what EVM extensions are?
EVM extensions behave like smart contracts that are compiled and deployed within the EVM. If you are familiar with the EVM, you may know them as Precompiles.
These have predefined addresses and, according to their logic, can be classified as stateful or stateless.
When they change the state of the chain (transactions)
or access state data (queries), extensions are considered "stateful";
when they don't, they're "stateless."
Find a [list of the available EVM extensions in the Evmos documentation](https://docs.evmos.org/develop/smart-contracts/evm-extensions).
:::

This article presents a step-by-step guide to use the EVM extensions
corresponding to the `staking` and `distribution` modules.
With these we are able to stake tokens with our favorite validator
and withdraw staking rewards from the Evmos protocol using a smart contract.

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- Know how to use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

## Resources

You will need this material to code along:

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- EVM extensions interfaces: [Distribution.sol](https://github.com/evmos/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/stateful/Distribution.sol)
  & [Staking.sol](https://github.com/evmos/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/stateful/Staking.sol)
- EVM extensions common types and authorization interfaces:
  [Types.sol](https://github.com/evmos/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/common/Types.sol) &
  [Authorization.sol](https://github.com/evmos/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/common/Authorization.sol):
- Example contract that uses the EVM extensions:
  [SimpleStaker.sol](https://github.com/evmos/extensions/blob/main/examples/simple-staker/contracts/SimpleStaker.sol)

**Use [this link](https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.js&optimize=false&runs=200&gist=cb19b4d41158234ba65d80c1f1bd2969) to open Remix with all the required files.**

## Approvals

Before executing certain transactions using the EVM Extensions,
the user interacting with the smart contract must first approve these.
This is a security measure, that is required to ensure
that no unauthorized transactions can be executed on behalf of the user.
In case of staking transactions, they should specify the amount allowed.
The smart contract developer can choose to either separate
the approval and execution of the EVM extensions transactions
or to combine them into a single transaction.

We have provided convenient constants (e.g.: `MSG_DELEGATE`, `MSG_UNDELEGATE`),
that store the corresponding message type URLs required for the approval process.

This is done by calling the `approve` function, which will create an authorization grant for the given Cosmos SDK message.

The [Simple Staker](https://github.com/evmos/extensions/blob/main/examples/simple-staker/contracts/SimpleStaker.sol) has the function `approveRequiredMethods()`
to perform the necessary approvals.
It approves the required methods for staking tokens (`MSG_DELEGATE`).

## Step 1: Compile the contract

- Go to [this link to open the Remix IDE with the necessary contracts](https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.js&optimize=false&runs=200&gist=cb19b4d41158234ba65d80c1f1bd2969)
- Compile the `SimpleStaker` contract with Remix

## Step 2: Connect MetaMask to the Evmos testnet

Follow [the corresponding guide on the Evmos docs](https://docs.evmos.org/use/connect-your-wallet/metamask) to achieve this.

## Step 3: Get some funds

If you don't have tEVMOS on your wallet,
get some tokens from the [Evmos Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.evmos.dev/).

## Step 4: Deploy the `SimpleStaker.sol` contract

- Go to ***Deploy & Run Transactions*** option on Remix's side bar
- Configure ***Injected Provider - MetaMask*** as the used environment
- Select the account with funds from the previous step
- Make sure the `SimpleStaker` compiled contract is selected in the ***CONTRACT*** field
- Deploy the smart contract by pressing the ***Deploy*** button & approving the transaction on Metamask

Upon a successful deployment,
you should see the contract with its exposed methods being listed under ***Deployed Contracts***.

## Step 5: Interact with the deployed contract

### Get current validators

To use the `SimpleStaker` contract, we need a validator's address.
Check the current validators on our [testnet Swagger API page](https://api.evmos.dev/#/Query/Validators) or directly via REST at the [/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/validators](https://rest.bd.evmos.dev:1317/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/validators) endpoint.

Copy the `operator_address` of the validator you want to use.
Use this as the `_validatorAddr` in the `SimpleStaker` functions.

### Grant approvals

Before performing any transaction,
make sure to set the corresponding approvals.
To do so, call the `approveRequiredMethods` function.
This function will grant permissions to the smart contract
to use the `MsgDelegate`
on behalf of the caller.

### Stake some tokens

Call the `stakeTokens` function using the validator address obtained previously
and the desired amount to stake.

Once the transaction is processed successfully,
you can check your current delegations calling the `getDelegation` function.

Additionally, you can check the current delegations using the [Swagger API page](https://api.evmos.dev/#/Query/DelegatorDelegations) where you use your Bech32-formatted address as the delegator.

### Withdraw staking rewards

Proceed similarly with the `withdrawRewards` function to get your staking rewards.
