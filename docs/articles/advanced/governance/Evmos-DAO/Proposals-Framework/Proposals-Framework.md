# **Proposals Framework**


## **Evmos Community Proposals (ECPs)**

ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAO's Governance system, and provides a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams.


## **The Evmos Community Proposal Framework**

The Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.
