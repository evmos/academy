# **Core Definitions and Concepts**


## **Proposal Types**


### **On-Chain Governance**

On-chain governance refers to all protocol-level execution of proposals using Cosmos SDK's `gov` module. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes, regardless of the voter's validator choices.


### **Off-Chain Governance**

Off-chain governance refers to all community decisions that do not require an on-chain protocol-level change. These types of decisions include various topics and concepts, from passing meta-governance proposals to forming special task forces or workstreams.

All proposals are assumed to be `On-Chain Proposals` until the necessary infrastructure and toolings for `Off-Chain Voting` is established. Cosmos SDK's `TextProposal` will be used for `Off-Chain Proposals` for the time being.

### **Community Proposals**
Proposals that only require to be posted as a `TextProposal` on the Cosmos SDK - _Most commonly used for meta-governance proposals._
---
### **Workstream & Special Initiatives**
Proposals that request any type of funding from the `CommunityPool` or the DAO's treasury to form an in-house workstream (team, squad, sub-DAO, guild) or project with the direct purpose of benefiting the Evmos ecosystem.

#### **Workstreams**

Workstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Outreach, Marketing & Creative Services, etc). More information on workstreams can be found on the DAO Workstreams page.

Workstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' Constitutional Values and community-run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in the scope of Evmos DAO's governance.

Anyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:



* Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the [Constitution.](https://evmos.community/constitution)
* Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.
* Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes, all in line with the budget proposal flow.

Workstreams have five potential states. Each of the five states and the requirements for a workstream in each state are outlined below:



* **Informal:** The workstream is not funded by the DAO and has not made a formal proposal with its goals and a budgetary request.
* **Proposed:** The workstream has made a formal proposal to the DAO for a working budget.
* **Active:** The workstream is active and funded by the DAO.
* **Inactive:** The workstream has been discontinued and is no longer being funded by the DAO.


#### **Special Initiatives / Projects**

Special Initiatives and Projects are DAO-funded projects with a set budget and "completion" goal or date (i.e., Governance Tooling Project, Event Sponsorships, etc.)

## **Proposal Phase & Identification Tags**

**You do not need to know the proposal phase and identification naming conventions! A Governance Council member will assist -- the content below is for reference.**

Proposal Phases are denoted as: `[IDEATION]`, `[PRE-PROPOSAL]`, `[PROPOSAL]`, `[VOTING]` for the 4-phases, and `[PASSED]`, `[REJECTED]`, `[DEFERRED]` for proposals in the other stages. Refer to the [Proposal Lifecycle](https://evmos.community/governance/proposals/lifecycle) page for more information on proposal lifecycle phases.

Proposal Identification Tags are only required for Governance, Workstream (subDAO), and Community Treasury Related Proposals Only

The `ECP-#` tag will be assigned and added by a Governance Council member in the `Phase 2: ECP Formalization` or `Phase 3: ECP Signaling` phase. **You do not have to worry about adding in the tag yourself.**

These tags are for internal tracking and organization purposes. Make sure to check the [Proposal Submission Guidelines](https://evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) for more information on how to properly prepare your proposal for on-chain voting.
