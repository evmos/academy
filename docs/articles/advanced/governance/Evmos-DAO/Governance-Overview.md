# **Evmos Network Governance**

Governance is the process of interaction and decision-making among the stakeholders of a given system or organization. It is also the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and upheld.


## **Truly Decentralized, Community Governed Network**

The Evmos network, like other Cosmos-based chains, utilizes `on-chain governance` for all protocol level execution of proposals via the `gov` module included in the Cosmos SDK. This gives the community full control of the network, including complex parameter changes, distribution changes, treasury pool spending, and even upgrades to the network. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes, regardless of the voter's validator choices. Immense power is given to the community to govern and dictate the future of the chain.


## **Limitations and Shortcomings**

While the governance module in Cosmos SDK is sufficient for on-chain governance, there are limitations and shortcomings of the module that make it difficult to conduct off-chain governance - a crucial component for a DAO to be able to operate efficiently. Furthermore, the Cosmos ecosystem is lacking the innovative DAO management toolings that EVM-based DAOs have at their disposal. We hope to bridge the growing gap in innovations and tools between Ethereum and Cosmos with the deployment of interoperable tools onto our EVM, opening up a new world of tools for IBC chains.
