# **Evmos DAO & Community Governance**


## **Evmos DAO**

**Evmos DAO** is the community-led & organized decentralized organization dedicated to the Evmos Network, which aims to continue its part in building the Evmos ecosystem.

The DAO operates under the Interim Constitution, passed by the Evmos community in Proposal #51.

The **Evmos Governance Framework** is still a work in progress and will be rolled out modularly. Like the Interim Constitution, the Framework will likely change and evolve as the network matures and grows.
