# Tashi

Tashi Markets is a revolutionary platform in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, offering users a smooth and empowering experience for financial activities like lending, borrowing, and earning block rewards with digital assets. At its core, Tashi allows users to generate passive income by contributing liquidity to the protocol, encouraging active participation.

The platform offers over-collateralized borrowing, which lets users securely obtain funds by using their supplied assets as collateral. Tashi's liquidity market ensures instant supply and withdrawal, offering users flexibility and real-time asset management. With the borrowing, users can access funds instantly without the complexities of traditional loan applications.

Tashi leverages extensive market data to provide users with a live and transparent view of interest rates. Users can monitor and track interest rates in real-time based on market supply and demand dynamics, enabling informed decisions about their assets. Tashi also enhances user experience with personalized notifications that keep users informed about their deployed positions in real-time.

Tashi distinguishes itself from other lending protocols by prioritizing long-term stability, utility, and value as key competitive advantages. Tashi’s tokenomics is designed with a focus on the community, providing staking rewards and rebates. Here are some notable differences:
Liquidity Aggregation and Evmos Integration:
Tashi leverages interoperability tooling, including EVM Extensions provided by Evmos, to aggregate liquidity from various chains into Evmos. This approach aims to create a robust and dynamic ecosystem, enhancing liquidity and accessibility for users.
Interest Rate Model and Capital Efficiency:
Tashi employs an innovative interest rate model designed for enhanced capital efficiency. The platform's tokenomics, with a total supply of 720M TASHI tokens, allocates rewards, rebates, and benefits for xTASHI holders through its Staking Program. This unique model differs from traditional DeFi platforms.
Over-Collateralized Borrowing and Real-Time Asset Management:
Tashi offers over-collateralized borrowing, allowing users to securely obtain funds by using their supplied assets as collateral. The protocol's liquidity market ensures instant supply and withdrawal capabilities, providing flexibility and real-time asset management for users.

## What can you do on Tashi

### Supplying Assets

Tashi Markets users can supply assets and earn block rewards depending on market demand. Additionally, they have the option to use supplied assets as collateral for borrowing. The protocol's governance, shifting to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), will enable community votes for adding token pools. Yield-bearing tokens (cTokens) are given to suppliers for withdrawing assets, which can be traded on Evmos. Users can supply assets, monitor block rewards, and withdraw through the dashboard. The dynamic system adjusts Annual Percentage Yields (APY) in real-time, reflecting market conditions and offering optimal returns. cTokens represent supplied assets and appreciate over time, providing an opportunity for increased asset quantity upon conversion.

### Borrowing Assets

When users anticipate their asset's value increase or want to access stable asset value without selling, they can borrow against supplied assets in the protocol, gaining liquidity without liquidating existing assets. To enable borrowing, users need to set supplied assets for collateral. The borrowing limit depends on the supplied value and existing liquidity. With the Borrow dashboard, users can choose the asset, enter the desired amount, and confirm the transaction. Borrowing incurs interest, and each asset has a different collateral factor determining the maximum borrowing amount. Repayments can be made through the Repayments tab, but they must use the same borrowed asset. Users can borrow indefinitely, but accrued interest affects Health, potentially leading to liquidation. To avoid this, users can repay the loan or add assets to increase Health.

### Check Health

Health serves as a security indicator for user assets used as collateral, represented by a numerical value. Higher Health implies greater safety, minimizing liquidation risk. When Health dips below 1, collateral might face partial liquidation. Health fluctuates based on supplied and borrowed asset values. A higher Health enhances collateral and borrowing safety, while lower Health increases vulnerability. Colored indicators offer visual cues for Health. Users improve Health by repaying borrowed amounts or adding more collateral. These actions empower users to manage positions actively, maintain a healthy borrowing profile, and decrease liquidation risks.

## TASHI Token

Tashi utilizes an innovative interest rate model for enhanced capital efficiency. With a total supply of 720M TASHI tokens, allocations include liquidity incentives, core contributors, DEX liquidity, public sale, partnerships, and reserves. The Staking Program offers block rewards, fee rebates, and benefits for xTASHI holders. Protocol earnings distribution prioritizes the xTASHI Rewards Fund initially.

## TASHI Governance

As Tashi evolves, it will shift towards a decentralized governance structure, ultimately forming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). In the initial phase, the founding team will initiate Tashi's launch. Governance participation will involve xTASHI token holders proposing and voting on TASHI Improvement Proposals that influence critical aspects such as economics, security, and protocol development. These proposals may cover parameters such as the interest rate model, asset additions, risk parameters, liquidity mining program adjustments, and general protocol enhancements. Active engagement by xTASHI token holders in the DAO governance is pivotal for shaping Tashi's future, ensuring continual improvement, security, and resilience.

### When will Tashi become a DAO?

Tashi recognizes the importance of maintaining a stable and reliable protocol, and therefore the team has prioritized balancing the needs of the platform while ensuring it is in impeccable working order before becoming a DAO. Addressing any vulnerabilities, fine-tuning the governance mechanisms, and enhancing the security measures to foster trust and confidence within the community, are top priorities. Only after these critical steps are completed will Tashi pass the protocol's control over to the DAO.
