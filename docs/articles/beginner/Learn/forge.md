# Forge DEX

Forge DEX distinguishes itself as the most capital-efficient exchange within the Cosmos and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) ecosystem, primarily attributed to the integration of the Uniswap v3 protocol.

Through the incorporation of the concentrated liquidity feature from Uniswap v3, Forge DEX empowers liquidity providers to strategically allocate their assets within personalized price ranges. This strategy substantially minimizes slippage and enhances capital efficiency for all users, delivering a more competitive and optimal trading experience on the platform.

Crafted with the community in consideration, Forge functions as a community-owned decentralized exchange that imposes no protocol fees. This distinctive model not only cultivates a shared sense of ownership but also stimulates increased engagement from users. Through the removal of protocol fees, Forge DEX strives to establish a more accessible and inclusive platform for traders, fostering transparency and trust within the ecosystem. The community-centric ethos of Forge DEX lays the foundation for a decentralized exchange that stays attuned to the needs and preferences of its users.

## What can we do on Forge

### DEX Protocol

Forge operates as a deployment of Uniswap v3 fork on the Evmos network. The Uniswap protocol represents a peer-to-peer system crafted for the exchange of cryptocurrency assets on Ethereum and EVMs. Enacted as a collection of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts, the protocol is intentionally structured to prioritize attributes such as censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and the ability to operate without reliance on trusted intermediaries that might selectively restrict access.

The Forge protocol diverges from the traditional approach by adopting an Automated Market Maker (AMM), sometimes known as a Constant Function Market Maker, in lieu of an order book.

On a broad scale, an AMM replaces the conventional buy and sell orders found in an order book market with a liquidity pool containing two assets, each valued in relation to the other. As one asset is exchanged for the other, the relative prices of the two assets undergo changes, determining a new market rate for both. In this dynamic, a buyer or seller engages directly with the pool, as opposed to interacting with specific orders left by other parties. 

### Forge Perpetuals:

Perpetuals, in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), refer to a specific type of derivative financial instrument known as perpetual contracts. Perpetual contracts are a type of futures contract with no expiration date. They are designed to mimic the features of a traditional futures contract while eliminating the need for a fixed maturity date.

Boasting over 160 liquidity sources spanning multiple chains, the self-proclaimed "Aggregator of Everything" empowers traders to access an extensive pool of $40B, encompassing contributions from various perpetual protocols like GMX and GNS.

### Range Orders:

Introducing a novel approach to automated market makers, customizable liquidity positions and the provision of single-sided assets give rise to a unique form of swapping known as the "range order."

In conventional order book markets, setting a limit order—whether to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price—permits the order to be filled at an unspecified time in the future.

Forge adopts the concept of a range order, where one can emulate a limit order by contributing a single asset as liquidity within a specified range. Similar to traditional limit orders, range orders can be established with the anticipation of execution at a later point, allowing withdrawal of the target asset after the spot price traverses the entire range.

In contrast to markets where limit orders may incur fees, the range order maker accrues fees during the order fulfillment process. This is attributed to the nature of the range order as a form of liquidity provisioning, differing from the conventional swap model.

Forge is adding significant value to the Evmos ecosystem by addressing key aspects of the DeFi space and contributing to the platform's growth and adoption. The notable contributions include:

### Self-Sustaining and Community Owned DEX

The Evmos community has successfully passed Proposal 142, endorsing the provision of liquidity for the main stEVMOS/EVMOS pair on Forge. The proposal specified a request for 2 million Evmos, with 1 million Evmos designated for liquid staking.

The management of the liquidity pool is presently overseen by the Evmos DAO, in collaboration with the OA (Operator Address) and two trusted and actively participating community members. This governance structure ensures 100% transparency and visibility on the block explorer.

Generated rewards from both liquid staking and the Forge liquidity pool (LP fees) will be directed to a multisig wallet. A segment of these rewards will be allocated to cover the operational expenses of the DEX, thereby ensuring its long-term sustainability and growth. The remaining rewards will be earmarked for Forge bounties. Importantly, the requested funds exclusively serve to provision liquidity to Forge, necessitating regular adjustments to the position.

Central to understanding Forge's philosophy and strategy is the recognition that Forge operates on distinctive principles, diverging from the conventional mechanisms observed in certain other decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Notably, Forge abstains from featuring an investment token and refrains from executing airdrops. Furthermore, the protocol fees implemented in Forge are deliberately set at 0%. These choices underscore the commitment to ensuring that Forge functions not as a tool for individual profit but as a community-owned public good.

Forge assumes a primary role as a catalyst for growth and innovation within the Evmos ecosystem. By aligning its operations with this mission, Forge aims to provide a platform that authentically serves its community. This shift away from individual profit orientation towards a focus on the public good signifies a renewed dedication to long-term growth and the overall health of the Evmos ecosystem.

### Governance:

At Forge, a commitment to transparency, decentralization, and active community engagement is evident. Currently, all governance processes for Forge transpire on-chain on the Evmos mainnet through the Cosmos SDK. This on-chain governance framework fosters transparency and equity, allowing all network participants to propose, deliberate, and vote on various initiatives that shape the network's trajectory.

As Forge experiences growth, there is an anticipation of an escalating need for increased flexibility and expeditious decision-making. The ongoing evolution of the network suggests the possibility of adaptations and refinements to the governance model, ensuring alignment with the ever-shifting landscape and responsiveness to the evolving needs of the dynamic community.

### Incentive Programs

The Evmos community has endorsed a significant governance proposal titled "Inferno - An Incentive Program to Bootstrap Liquidity in Forge." This proposal, collaboratively introduced by the Evmos DAO, Orbital Apes, and Forge, aims to establish sustainable liquidity and volume on Forge, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Evmos.

To facilitate the program's execution, the community has earmarked 3,000,000 Evmos for incentivizing liquidity provision on the Forge DEX. Participants in liquidity provision have the potential to earn through three channels: staking rewards, liquidity emissions from the program, and LP fees. This multi-reward approach marks a pioneering initiative within the Cosmos ecosystem.

### Partnership with Revert Finance

It is noteworthy to highlight Forge's ongoing incentive program in collaboration with Revert Finance, incorporating a unique staking mechanism. This initiative rewards users for participating in liquidity provision, serving as a precursor to broader staking opportunities within the Forge ecosystem. Detailed information about this staking mechanism is readily accessible on Revert Finance's official website: https://revert.finance/
