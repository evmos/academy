# Stride

Stride, a dynamic blockchain or "zone," stands as a liquidity provider for staked tokens, offering users the ability to liquidly stake their tokens from any Cosmos chain. This innovative platform enables users to earn both staking and DeFi yields within the expansive Cosmos IBC ecosystem.

Currently, Stride supports liquid staking for a variety of tokens across different Cosmos chains, including Cosmos Hub (stATOM), Osmosis (stOSMO), Injective (stINJ), Stargaze (stSTARS), Evmos (stEVMOS), Terra 2 (stLUNA), Umee (stUMEE), Juno (stJUNO), Comdex (stCMDX), and Sommelier (stSOMM).

Users engaging with Stride immediately receive staked tokens upon liquid staking, with rewards accumulating in real-time for staked token holders. These staked tokens are freely tradable and can be redeemed at any time through Stride, which returns the native tokens along with staking rewards.

On the backend, Stride autonomously stakes these tokens on the host chain, compounding user rewards. Users can continually earn staking yield and explore additional yield-generating opportunities through lending, liquidity provision, and more.

The redemption process with Stride is seamless. Upon redemption, Stride initiates unbonding on the host zone, and once the unbonding period ends, the users receive native tokens directly in their wallets.

Striding into the future, the platform envisions rapid expansion throughout the Cosmos ecosystem. The onboarding of new chains is straightforward, allowing anyone to propose the addition of a new chain through a governance vote, which, when passed, automatically integrates the new chain into Stride.

Looking ahead, Stride has ambitious plans to onboard various chains and tokens in the next 12 months, including dYdX (stDYDX), Celestia (stTIA), Agoric (stBLD), Axelar (stAXL), Akash (stAKT), Secret (stSCRT), Kava (stKAVA), Oasis (stROSE), Regen (stREGEN), and many more. Stride aims to support all IBCv3-compatible tokens, labeled as "st"-Tokens, solidifying its commitment to inclusivity and innovation.

Built on Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, and crafted with Ignite, Stride leverages cutting-edge technology to provide a robust and versatile platform for the evolving landscape of staking and liquidity provision in the Cosmos ecosystem.

### Incentivized Staking and Testnet Users

Chains participating in Stride's liquid staking join the Airdrop Program, where addresses staking the chainâ€™s governance token are eligible for a share of airdropped STRD based on their stakes. A minimum threshold of $100 and a maximum threshold of $50,000 are in place, ensuring effective management of addresses during the distribution process. Addresses below the minimum or exceeding the maximum threshold are ineligible or limited, respectively.

### Providing Liquidity on Osmosis

Stride presents users with a unique opportunity to actively participate in the financial ecosystem of the Cosmos blockchain by providing liquidity for their staked tokens. Stride's user-friendly approach enables token holders to contribute to the broader financial ecosystem seamlessly, creating a space where their staked assets can actively participate in various financial activities and transactions within the Cosmos network. Similarly, we can also provide liquidity on other platforms such as Forge, Astroport, and Shade DEX.

### Borrowing against stTokens on Umee

Once your stTokens have been moved to Umee, you can supply them on the Umee money market, unlocking opportunities to earn lending yield and utilize them as collateral for cross-chain borrowing. The Umee app provides a convenient interface where you can explore a curated list of featured markets for various assets, offering a seamless experience in managing and leveraging your stTokens within the Umee ecosystem. Additionally, we can also borrow tokens against stTokens on other platforms such as Mars Protocol.
