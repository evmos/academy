# What is IBC?

IBC stands for Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol. It is a protocol that enables communication and interoperability between different blockchain networks.
IBC enables various use cases such as cross-chain token transfers, cross-chain staking, and cross-chain marketplaces, among others. It also allows for the creation of new decentralized applications that span multiple blockchain networks.

IBC, a core module of the CosmosSDK, will enable developers and users to seamlessly interact across sovereign blockchains.
