# What is EVM?

EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is a software environment that runs on the Ethereum network and enables smart contracts to be executed.

The EVM is responsible for executing smart contracts written in Solidity, the primary programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The EVM is also responsible for managing the state of the Ethereum network, which includes managing account balances, transactions, and contract execution.

Overall, the EVM serves as the backbone of the Ethereum network and enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications that are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.

Evmos aims to provide a high-performance implementation of the EVM that is interoperable with other blockchains through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.
