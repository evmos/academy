# DAO Workstreams (aka Sub-DAOs, Teams)

## Definition and Purpose

Workstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).

Workstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.

## Workstream Requirements

Anyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:

- Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the [Constitution](/constitution).
- Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.
- The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in
- The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI
- Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the budget proposal flow.

## Workstream Formation Process

Workstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)

The burden falls mostly on the proposers of the sub-DAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.

A great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.

## Workstream Stages

Workstreams have five potential states. Each of the five states and the requirements for a workstream in each state are outlined below:

- **Informal:** The workstream is not funded by the DAO, and has not made a formal proposal with its goals and a budgetary request.
- **Proposed:** The workstream has made a formal proposal to the DAO for a working budget.
- **Active:** The workstream is active and funded by the DAO. 
- **Inactive:** The workstream has been discontinued and is no longer being funded by the DAO.
