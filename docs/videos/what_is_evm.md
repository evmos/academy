## Have you ever heard of EVM?

EVM is a computational engine that runs on the Ethereum network and enables smart contracts.

It's the driving force behind executing smart contracts. And they're written in Solidity. That's the primary programming language used for crafting these blockchain-based agreements.

The EVM is also responsible for managing the state of the Ethereum network. This includes managing account balances, transactions, and contract execution.

The EVM enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications that are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.
