## Let’s talk about crypto wallets. 

- What they are.
- How they work. 
- Why you should care.  

Unlike traditional wallets, Crypto wallets don’t actually store physical fiat currency. In fact, they don’t store crypto or NFTs, either! 

Crypto wallets store your private keys.  AKA the passwords that give you ACCESS to your crypto assets. Think of it as proof of ownership.

As long as you have your private keys, you have access, and if you have access, you can sign transactions on the blockchain. This means you can do everything from sending crypto to another wallet to buying NFTs off marketplaces and even participating in Decentralized Finance.

But remember, when you use a non-custodial crypto wallet, YOU are solely responsible for the security of your assets. So keep your private keys SECURE and never share them with anyone.
