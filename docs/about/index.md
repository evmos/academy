# Welcome to Evmos Academy

Welcome to Evmos Academy, a growing hub for technical developers looking to expand their knowledge of blockchain and development. Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to transform industries, but understanding it can be challenging due to its complex nature. Evmos Academy provides tutorials and guides to help you better understand the concepts and principles of blockchain and how to develop blockchain-based applications.

The site is broken down into two groups, developers and community users. We cover a wide range of topics, including the basics of blockchain, smart contract development, decentralized applications (dApps), submitting governance proposals, and more. Our tutorials are designed to be easy to follow, even if you have little to no prior knowledge of blockchain development.
